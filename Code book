The R script titled run_analysis.R was created as part of the Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The script performs
the required actions as per the course requirements.

1. Downloading the data
  - Data downloaded from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" and saved with the name UCI HAR Dataset
  
2. Assigning a variable name to each dataset:
  - featuredataset is from features.txt with 561 rows and 2 columns
  - traindataX is from train/X_train.txt with 7352 rows and 561 columns
  - traindataY is from train/y_train.txt with 7352 rows and 1 column
  - traindatasubject is from train/subject_train.txt with 7352 rows and 1 column
  - testdataX is from test/X_test.txt with 2947 rows and 561 columns
  - testdataY is from test/y_test.txt with 2947 rows and 1 column
  - testdatasubject is from test/subject_test.txt with 2947 rows and 1 column
  - activitylabelsdata is from activity_labels.txt with 6 rows and 2 columns

3. Merging the training and test datasets to create one dataset
  - Xdataset is created from traindataX and testdataX using the rbind() function and has 10299 rows and 561 columns
  - Ydataset is created from traindataY and testdataY using the rbind() function and has 10299 rows and 1 column
  - Subjectdataset is created from traindatasubject and testdatasubject using the rbind() function and has 10299 rows and 1 column
  - Alldataset is created from Subjectdataset, Ydataset and Xdataset using the cbind() function and has 10299 rows and 563 columns

4. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Meanstddataset is created by subsetting Alldataset and selecting only the following columns:
  - subject
  - code
  - measurements on mean
  - measurements on standard deviation

5. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
All the numbers in the code column of Meanstddataset is changed with the corresponding activity from the second column of activitylabelsdata.

6. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
  - The code column in Meanstddataset is renamed to activities
  - All Acc in the column name is changed to Accelerometer
  - All Gyro in the column name is changed to Gyroscope
  - All BodyBody in the column name is changed to Body
  - All Mag in the column name is changed to Magnitude
  - All that starts with the character t in the column name is changed to Time
  - All that starts with the character f in the column name is changed to Frequency

7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
Tidydata is created by grouping Meanstddataset by subject and activity and 
summarising this grouped dataset by taking the mean of each variable for each subject and each activity
Tidydata has 180 rows and 88 columns

8. Write the final tidy data table
Tidydata is written / exported into tidydata.txt file.
